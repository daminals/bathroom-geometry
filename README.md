# SBU Bathroom Finder
SBU Bathroom Finder is a WebApp that helps you find the nearest and greatest bathroom for you on StonyBrook's Campus! It allows for users to 
filter the bathrooms by not only gender, but accesibility, ratings, and amenities as well! 
While it's currently limited to StonyBrook's Campus as it's the campus we're most familiar with, community members from other universities can 
feel free to contribute to our repo and create maps for their campuses using our built-in map creator! 

This project was made for [Hopper Hacks 2024](https://hopperhacks2024.devpost.com/) and we hope you enjoy our project!  

# Inspiration 
We're all residents of NYC and a common problem we tend to run into is finding the nearest bathroom that's also accessible and regularly cleaned. 
However, NYC is a large city and it'd be pretty hard to locate and keep track of the bathroom's on such a scale. So, we decided to shift our focus 
to the University we all know and love, SBU! We have enough knowledge about the bathrooms on campus for a proof of concept and it could always be 
scaled up later. Additionally, all the group members have taken a class in Computational Geometry here at SBU and we really wanted to see if we could 
apply what we learned in that class in the real world.
